# Android_Studio_For_Fun_Projects
These small Android Studio Projects were done from my curiousity of the creation of apps. 

### CalculateMyTip
This project helps the user calculate tips, providing the exact value of tip amounts for 15 and 18 percent of the given price. Respective buttons for 15 and 18 percent tip 
is displayed.

### HighLowGame
This small project is a guessing game, allowing the user to guess between zero and a hundred (inclusively). A hint of if the guess is too high or low will appear when a guess is 
submitted. Another button for creating a new random number also exists.
